# F to A
Please proceed to `F_to_A` folder.

You worked really hard in a class, but the final grade is, unfortunately, `F`. However, you have a chance to recover your grade. The instructor told you that they would use an ML-based system to automatically read the letter grades from the instructor's handwritten note (Ugh... yeah). Now you think that: "If I can manipulate the handwritten letter from `F` to `A`, I will receive `A` grade." To do this, we offered the instructor's handwritten grade `F` to `f.png`. Now use the template (or do it manually) to manipulate the `F` to `A`. Note that the ML model only accepts images flipped horizontally and rotated 90 degrees, so when you manually modify the `F` image, you need to apply the same flipping and rotating. To help you with this, we also provided a sample `sample.png`.

Once you have your manipulated `F` as `f_manipulated.png`. You can run the `launcher`. If you're lucky and successful in getting `A`, you will have the flag.

Good luck
